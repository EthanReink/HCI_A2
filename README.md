**Changes between first assignment and second assignment:**


-Removed text from back buttons and added arrows intsead

-Removed ability to loop through screens (Assignment List -> Chat List -> Chat -> Back to Assignment List) for clarity

-Removed entire chat list screen (Chats can be found under corresponding courses.  Changed from previous iteration where courses could also be found under corresponding chats, very confusing)



**New Features:**


-Course announcements (Or some form of communication between teacher and students)

-Private messaging (Only 1 group chat per course available right now, no individual messaging)

-Login & Signup Page (Would allow multiple students to use same device for their classes)

-Calendar view of assignment deadlines for all classes

-Notifications for close deadlines of unsubmitted assignments
